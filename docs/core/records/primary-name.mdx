# The Primary name

## How name resolution works

The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your ENS name, effectively helping DApps and other services display your ENS name based on your wallet address.

The easiest way to understand it is to consider that name resolution works in two directions:

### Forward resolution
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Your ENS Name);
B(Your wallet address);

A-->B;
```
Forward resolution is simply where your name points to and is determined by the `ETH Address` record set on your ENS name.

### Reverse resolution
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
       'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%

graph LR;
A(Your ENS Name);
B(Your wallet address);

B-->A;
```
Reverse resolution is where your wallet points to and is determined by the `Primary name` record set in your wallet.
