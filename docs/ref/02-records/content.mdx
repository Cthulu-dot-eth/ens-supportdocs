# The Content record
One of the most interesting and powerful features of ENS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web, creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is entirely decentralized, meaning that neither is hosted on any one server.

## Supported protocols
ENS supports several different decentralized storage protocols where you can host your website:

:::info Supported protocols
| Protocol    | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| IPFS & IPNS | The InterPlanetary FileSystem    |
| Arweave     | The PermaWeb Hard drive          |
| Onion 2 & 3 | The Tor Project                  |
| Sia         | Sia Decentralized Datastorage    |
| Swarm (bzz) | Swarm decentralized data storage |

:::caution No support for web2
ENS does not support pointing your ENS name to a Web2 (http/https) address. Though there is a workaround, see
