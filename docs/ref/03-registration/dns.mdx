# DNS Names
ENS supports importing DNS names into ENS, which makes it possible to use, for example, your `.com` `.net` or `.org` DNS name with ENS.
  
There are a few pre-requisites to importing a DNS name into ENS:

 - The DNS name must have DNSSEC enabled with `RSA/SHA-256` or `ECDSA` keys
   
 - An `_ens` `TXT record` must be created on the DNS name containing the wallet address to prove ownership of it.
