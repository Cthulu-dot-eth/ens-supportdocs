# Secondary markets
After purchasing an ENS name from a secondary marketplace it's important to keep a few things in mind:

 * The registration period is *inherited* from the previous owner, so double-check the expiration date using the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).
  
 * *Only* the `Registrant` record is updated with your wallet address, all other records like the `Controller` and `ETH Address` records remain set to the old owner's address until you change it.
