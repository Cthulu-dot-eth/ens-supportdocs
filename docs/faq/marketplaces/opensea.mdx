# OpenSea
OpenSea is a third-party marketplace run by a separate private company and is unaffiliated with Ethereum Name Service, as such we don't have any access to their systems to fix problems that are isolated to their platform.

## ENS name doesn't show

While ENS names appear and start working immediately in the ENS app, it can sometimes take a much longer time for them to show on third-party marketplaces because they only update their internal databases every once in a while.

When you're experiencing this issue the ENS names will show up either as a series of digits or as "Unknown ENS name". To fix this refresh the metadata:
> [**Refresh metadata**](#refresh-metadata)


## Refresh metadata
<BrowserWindow url="opensea.io">
  <Image img="/img/opensea-unknown1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

This schedules a refresh of the metadata in OpenSea's internal databases and usually resolves the issue in the next few hours.

:::note
If the ENS name still doesn't show up correctly after 24 hours you need to contact OpenSea's support for assistance, see [**OpenSea:** Support](#support)
