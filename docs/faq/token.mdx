# ENS Voting Token
The **ENS ERC-20 Voting Token**, hereafter referred to as the `ENS Token` is a pure governance token.
Meaning that its sole purpose is to vote on proposals put forth in the [ENS DAO Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains).

## Will ENS revenue be distributed to ENS Token holders?
No.

## Can the ENS DAO initiate buy backs of ENS Tokens?
Technically speaking the ENS DAO can do that if enough people voted in favour of it.
*However,* doing so just to artificially inflate the price of the `ENS Token` would violate [ENS Constitution](https://constitution.ens.domains)

## How long are tokens locked?
