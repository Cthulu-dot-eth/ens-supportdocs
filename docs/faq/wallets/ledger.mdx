## Unable to interact with smart contracts
### Enable Blind signing *(formerly called Contract Data)*
Interacting with smart contracts such as ENS using your Ledger requires `Blind signing` to be enabled on your device.
* Start and unlock your Ledger Nano S or X.
* Open the Ethereum App.
* Go to `Settings` **â†’** `Blind signing` and press both buttons to enable it.
Now you should be able to interact with smart contracts and ENS.

:::info
This setting resets every time the Ledger hardware device is updated.

## Metamask bridge
Sometimes the Metamask-Ledger bridge loses contact with the Ledger device, resulting in transactions that are never prompted for confirmation on the Ledger device, and which show up in the Metamask UI as "pending" in perpetuity.

Those transactions are never performed on-chain and needs to be cleared by following the instructions in Stuck transactions.

After those instructions have been followed, disconnect your Ledger device, restart your browser, reconnect your Ledger and try again.
