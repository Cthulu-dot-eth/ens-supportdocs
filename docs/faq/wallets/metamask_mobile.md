## Clearing the cache, cookies or browser data in Metamask doesn't work
There is an [open issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/2009) for Metamask where it doesn't clear the cache, cookies or other data even when the user clears them in settings, and also doesn't update the cache for the page by itself and so the dapps visited can be months old.

The only solution so far is to either reinstall metamask or preferably to use a dedicated browser app such as brave, chrome or safari which tends to work better than the built-in browsers in mobile wallet apps.
