# Metamask
Metamask suffers from several known bugs documented below.

## Clearing stuck transactions
Sometimes transactions in Metamask can get stuck without being performed. You can verify whether a transaction is stuck in Metamask or not by looking up your wallet on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io) and comparing the transactions there to the ones visible in your wallet.

:::caution
Transactions can get stuck in Metamask due to a bug in the UI. This is not the same as transactions that have stalled due to too low gas fees.
:::

To clear transactions stuck in Metamask you'll have to reset the wallet:
Open up Metamask and select the multi-coloured circle to bring up settings  
<BrowserWindow>
  <Image img="/img/metamask-stuck1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Go to `Settings` **→** `Advanced` **→** `Reset Account` and confirm.

## Unknown ENS name
MetaMask gets its ENS name metadata from OpenSea, which sometimes experiences delays in updating the metadata of names which can cause ENS names in MetaMask to show up as unknown.

To fix this follow the instructions in:
> [**OpenSea:** ENS Name Doesn't Show](../marketplaces/opensea.md#ens-name-doesnt-show)

## Doesn't show ENS tokens
Metamask doesn't yet show ENS tokens in your wallet by default, but the good news is that we're able to import the token into Metamask.
  
Go to the [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72)-page for the ENS voting token *or* the [ENS Domain token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85).
Next to `Profile Summary` on the right-hand side, press *more* to bring up its sub-menu.
<BrowserWindow>
  <Image img="/img/metamask-unknown1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Select `Add token to Metamask (Web3)`
<BrowserWindow>
  <Image img="/img/metamask-unknown2.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Confirm adding the token in Metamask  
<BrowserWindow>
  <Image img="/img/metamask-unknown3.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Now your ENS voting tokens and/or ENS domain tokens should be visible in your Metamask wallet.

## Exaggerated gas costs
Metamask has a [known bug](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13135) where users are shown an incredibly high gas fee estimate if there isn't enough ETH in the wallet to cover the actual transaction costs.

<BrowserWindow>
  <Image img="/img/metamask-exaggerated1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

This can be solved by transferring more ETH into the wallet to cover the actual transaction cost which should be a lot less than what Metamask shows when it's encountering this bug.
