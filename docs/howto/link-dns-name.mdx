## Hosting providers
A list of popular hosting providers and which DNSSEC key types they support[^1]

[^1]: The key-types hosting providers support may have changed since this list was last verified on `June 22nd, 2022`.

| ----------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| easyDNS           | `Yes`  | `Yes`       | `Yes` | [`DNSSEC Guide`](https://kb.easydns.com/knowledge/dnssec/)     |
| Google Cloud DNS  | `Yes`  | `Yes`       | `Yes` | [`DNSSEC Guide`](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/registrars) |
| Bluehost          | `Yes`  | `Yes`       | `Yes` |                                                                |
| Hostinger         | `Yes`  | `Yes`       | `Yes` |                                                                |

| Wordpress         | `No`   | -           | -     |                                                                |

## Step 1: Enable DNSSEC

Go to the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and search for your DNS name. You should see a screen like this:
<BrowserWindow url="app.ens.domains">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If your DNS provider supports DNSSEC, all you do is enable the option in their DNS manager:
<BrowserWindow url="support.ensmods.xyz">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-2.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If they don’t, you’ll need to migrate to a DNS provider that does. See:
> [**Hosting providers**](#hosting-providers)

## Step 2: Add the TXT-record
The DNS Registrar on ENS looks for a `TXT record` to verify ownership of the domain. This record has the following attributes:

|          |                    |
| -------- | -------------------|
| Type     | `TXT`              |
| Name     | `_ens`             |
| Contents | `a=wallet address` |
| TTL      | `36000`            |

To prove ownership of your DNS name, create a `TXT record` in your DNS zone, _ens.yourdomain.xyz, with text data of the form `a=walletaddress`... where `walletaddress` is the Ethereum wallet you want to give control of the ENS record to.

</BrowserWindow>

## Step 3: Linking the name with ENS
Now you should be able to go back to the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and finish linking the DNS name with ENS by pressing `Register`.
