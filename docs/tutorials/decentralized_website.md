# Create a decentralized website
One of the most interesting and powerful features of ENS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web, creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is *entirely* decentralized.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to deploy a basic website to IPFS and point your ENS name to it.
:::note
ENS supports several decentralized protocols apart from IPFS, but this tutorial only covers IPFS (for now)

## Build a website
In this section we'll create a basic website to deploy to IPFS using [Heaven's Tools](https://heavens.tools) excellent Web3 website builder.
:::note
If you already have a website you'd like to upload, proceed to [**Set up a GitHub repository**](#set-up-a-github-repository)
:::

### Step 1: Create the website
Go to [Heaven's Tools](https://heavens.tools) website and use the drag and drop building blocks to create your site.
