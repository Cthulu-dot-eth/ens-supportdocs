# Create a decentralized website
One of the most interesting and powerful features of ENS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web, creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is *entirely* decentralized.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to deploy a basic website to IPFS and point your ENS name to it.
:::note
ENS supports several decentralized protocols apart from IPFS, but this tutorial only covers IPFS (for now)
:::

## Build a website
In this section we'll create a basic website to deploy to IPFS using [Heaven's Tools](https://heavens.tools) excellent Web3 website builder.
:::note
If you already have a website you'd like to upload, proceed to [**Set up a GitHub repository**](#set-up-a-github-repository)
:::

### Create the website
Go to [Heaven's Tools](https://heavens.tools) website and use the drag and drop building blocks to create your site.

### Download the website
Once you're happy with the site you've created click the `Download` button to download a compressed `.zip` archive of your website.

### Extract the compressed archive
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
             Instructions for Windows
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS">
             <img
             src={require('/img/tutorials/extract_file_macos_1.png').default}
             alt="Extract File 1"
             />
             <img
             src={require('/img/tutorials/extract_file_macos_2.png').default}
             alt="Extract File 1"
             />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             Navigate to the file folder and use `unzip` to unzip the archive.
             <img
             src={require('/img/tutorials/extract_file_linux.png').default}
             alt="Extract File 1"
             />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set up a GitHub repository
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account.

### Create a repository
Click `New` to create a new GitHub repository for your website.

Then scroll down and click on `Create`.
![Picture 5](/img/tutorials/decentralized_website_5.png)

### Upload your files to the repository
On the next screen, click the link `Uploading an existing file`
![Picture 6](/img/tutorials/decentralized_website_6.png)

Upload your files to GitHub
![Picture 7](/img/tutorials/decentralized_website_7.png)

After that's done, scroll down and click `Commit`.

## Upload it to IPFS (using Fleek)

### Create an account with Fleek
Go to [Fleek's website](https://fleek.co) and `Sign Up` for an account.

### Upload your site to Fleek
After logging into [Fleek](https://fleek.co), at the dashboard select `Add new site`.
![Picture 3](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_1.png)

Choose `Connect with GitHub` and connect your GitHub account. 
![Picture 4](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_2.png)

Click `Install & Authorize`
![Picture 5](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_3.png)

When asked which repository to create the website from, select the repository you created earlier in [](#step-1-create-a-repository)
![Picture 6](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_4.png)

For the hosting service, make sure IPFS is selected and press `Continue`.
![Picture 7](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_5.png)

On the next screen no changes are necessary, so just scroll down and click `Deploy site`.
![Picture 8](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_6.png)

Fleek will now deploy the website to IPFS, which might take a little while.
![Picture 9](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_7.png)

When the site has been deployed, it will look like this:
![Picture 10](/img/tutorials/create_website_fleek_8.png)

Select the `IPFS CID` *(marked in blue below)* and press `CTRL + C` to copy it into the clipboard or write it down.

## Set the `Content` record on your ENS name

### Go to the ENS Manager App
Go to the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and connect your wallet.

Click on `My Account` to go to a list of your ENS names.

Go to your ENS name and click `Add/Edit Record`, scroll down and enter the `IPFS CID` you saved earlier into the `Content` field, then scroll down and click `Save`

Congratulations! That's it!
