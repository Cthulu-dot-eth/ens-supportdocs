## An easy-to-remember name for all your wallet addresses
The first and most common use case for an ENS name is to use it as an easy-to-remember name for your cryptocurrency addresses.

ENS supports many different cryptocurrencies which can be added to it from the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum.

This alleviates the confusion associated with remembering your hexadecimal wallet address and provides easy payment options.

## Connect metadata to the Ethereum blockchain
* **Social media**  
*ENS Names support numerous text records which can be used to provide on-chain metadata to connect to your social media accounts. For example, you can add your Twitter or discord handles to your ENS records.*
  
* **URLs and E-Mail**  
*Your ENS name can store your e-mail and website so people can easily find them.*
  
* **Custom Text records**  
*Your ENS name is also capable of storing custom records to can contain nearly anything you want to display or integrate into your services.*
