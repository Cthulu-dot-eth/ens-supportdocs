# ENS Name Fees
How much does it cost to register an ENS name?

| Name length *(number of characters)* | Cost per year |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| 3 characters                         | US $640       |
| 4 characters                         | US $160       |
| 5+ characters                        | US $5         |

Three and four-character names cost more to reflect the small number of these names available. If a name was recently released from the expiration grace period, a decaying price premium is also applied.

## Estimating costs
When looking up an ENS name the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) will display a *rough* estimate of your registration cost:
<BrowserWindow url="app.ens.domains">

</BrowserWindow>

Gas prices might fluctuate after this estimate, especially if you don't complete the registration immediately.

:::note
The [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) charges 10% more than the estimate shown to guard against fluctuations in ETH value, the extra amount is returned to you in the same transaction.

## Why are fees collected?
The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace
from becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names.
  
A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund the ongoing development of ENS.

**ENS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.**

## Gas fees
Due to the way Ethereum works, all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain incur a gas fee in addition to the registration fee.
The price of gas constantly fluctuates depending on Ethereum congestion.

By using a [gas tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) it's possible to pinpoint times when gas is low to save money.

## Premium fee
There's an additional premium fee attached to newly expired names which start at $100m and declines exponentially to $0 over 21 days.
