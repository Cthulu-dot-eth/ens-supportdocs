# Address records
ENS provides several address records for your various cryptocurrency wallets. By default five different wallet records are shown in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains):

| Name   | Blockchain          | Details                     |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ETH`  | Ethereum blockchain | *Where the ENS name points* |
| `BSC`  | Binance Smart Chain |                             |
| `DOGE` | Doge blockchain     |                             |
| `LTC`  | Litecoin blockchain |                             |
| `BTC`  | Bitcoin blockchain  |                             |

But several other types of wallets can be added from the dropdown list in the manager app:
<BrowserWindow url="app.ens.domains">
