# What can I use an ENS name for?

## An easy-to-remember name for all your wallet addresses
The first and most common use case for an ENS name is to use it as an easy-to-remember name for your cryptocurrency addresses.

ENS supports many different cryptocurrencies which can be added to it from the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum.

This alleviates the confusion associated with remembering your hexadecimal wallet address and provides easy payment options.

## Point to decentralized websites
By coupling your decentralized ENS name with a service for hosting decentralized websites, it's possible to have an entirely decentralized website suitable for Web3. The protocols currently supported are:

|Protocol    |Description                      |
|------------|---------------------------------|
|IPFS & IPNS |InterPlanetary FileSystem        |
|Arweave     |PermaWeb Hard drive              |
|Onion 2 & 3 |Tor Project                      |
|Sia         |Sia Decentralized Datastorage    |
|Swarm (bzz) |Swarm decentralized data storage |
